# YosemiteBlack

#What is this?

This is a pitch black version of the Ultra Flat Yosemite Light theme of gnome-look user mfy found here:

http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ultra-flat-Yosemite?content=168521

This is not being actively developed anymore because I switched to another DE.

Current state is definitely usable, but there are some quirks that need to be ironed out.

Feel free to copy the project and continue it!

Let me know if you do, so I can link yours here.

#How to install

-Copy the folder YosemiteBlack to /usr/share/themes/

-Select the theme in your system settings

This has only been tested with Ubuntu's Unity-interface. Let me know if you find any problems and I'll try to fix them.
